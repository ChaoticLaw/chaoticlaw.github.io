Thanks to a lot of student projects, I have a webspace almost everywhere to the point that I am buried under the whole pile of them. Thankfully, I can just redirect you to the other sites so I can forget about it later, and never have to worry about it again.

Well, almost never.

# Main site
[My website][website_mine] should hopefully be done at some point so I can impress people with how it looks. At the moment, it's still under construction. There will be a proper blog post at some point.

# Student Journal
[This blog/journal][journal] is where I end up making educational posts, usually on the topic of web technologies. It runs on a hosted Wordpress account, so at the very least, it runs pretty fast.

# Github repo
[The repository][git_repo] is provided here, but you probably won't see it since it's private. At least you can [contact me][email] to get access.
